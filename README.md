# Virtual Cards Against Humanity
Implementation of Cards Against Humanity to use JavaScript. 

I had to dive in and write awful code, to be able to then regret it. Only then could I make the next learning step. Significant C++ then C# experience is not always the best thing; Javascript was, no: is, challenging because of its syntatactical simalarity to those two. This project is the shit javascript code I had to write to regret; I've learnt a lot only because of it. And while it's shit code, it's also a fun game. âœ¨ðŸŒŸ
