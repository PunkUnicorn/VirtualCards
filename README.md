-Can create a game when a games created due to unfinishedness

-No duplicate player or game name check due to unfinishedness

-I didn't make Cards Against Humanity

-I didn't even invent this format of the game, I copied it off a friend. Thanks Tony. 
-All I did was some CSS annimations and furious JavaScript

-node 4.2.3 and execute server.js

- OR
